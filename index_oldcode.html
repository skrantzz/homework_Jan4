        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hiyyaaa, I'm Sydney. Photography is my #1 passion, but I'm constantly learning new things and challenging
            myself. The commercial photography industry is not kind to artists, so I wanted to expand my skill set and
            have another means of income, as well. I've had a couple app ideas, but never had the means to bring them to
            life, so instead of waiting around, I decided to take things into my own hands. </p>
