          Hiyyaaa, I'm Sydney. Photography is my #1 passion, but I'm constantly
          learning new things and challenging myself. The commercial photography
          industry is not kind to artists, so I wanted to expand my skill set
          and have another means of income, as well. I've had a couple app
          ideas, but never had the means to bring them to life, so instead of
          waiting around, I decided to take things into my own hands.
